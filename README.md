Hello everyone!

I decided to upload my programming problems from 1st semester at uni. 
I'm not pretty sure that the next Winter Semester will have the same tasks/assignments or it'll be different.
But use these only if you don't know how to solve a problem by yourself. 
Also I cannot say that these solutions will be 100% correct.

Have a nice day :)
